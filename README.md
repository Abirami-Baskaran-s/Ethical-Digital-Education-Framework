📌 Project Overview

Developed a comprehensive Strategic Information Systems Plan (SISP) for Yoobee College, a tertiary education provider in New Zealand. This project involved auditing a fragmented IS environment ,characterized by manual processes and legacy systems—and designing a future-state architecture centered on digital transformation, data-driven decision-making, and cultural equity.

🛠️ Problem Space & Analysis

+Current State Audit: Identified critical weaknesses in the existing legacy Student Management System (SMS) and Learning Management System (LMS), which lacked real-time integration and caused duplicate data entry.

+Risk Identification: Used the Iceberg Model and Risk Register to identify systemic issues, including inconsistent student achievement in online programs and a lack of formal academic risk tracking.

+Strategic Alignment: Conducted a PESTEL analysis to align IS goals with NZ education regulations, Te Tiriti o Waitangi obligations, and emerging AI/Cloud trends.

🚀 Key Solutions & Strategic Proposal

+Centralized Infrastructure: Proposed an integrated SMS-LMS ecosystem to automate enrollment, attendance, and reporting, creating a "single source of truth" for student data.

+Data Analytics & AI: Designed a framework for real-time performance dashboards and AI-driven analytics to track student retention and close achievement gaps for Māori and Pasifika learners.

+Cultural Data Sovereignty: Integrated Māori Data Sovereignty principles (Tino Rangatiratanga, Kaitiakitanga) into the system design to ensure ethical and culturally responsive data management.

+Compliance & Governance: Built-in mechanisms for NZQA compliance, NZ Privacy Act 2020, and GDPR standards to mitigate legal and reputational risks.
